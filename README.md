# Data Science Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various data science algorithms from scratch(mathematical) in Python. The algorithms include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **PCA, etc**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib,seaborn (for visualizations)
- etc

### Installing
clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/srihar5ha/DATASCI.git

### Running the code

Each algorithm has its own Jupyter notebook with the code and explanations. You can open the notebook and run the code cells.

## Examples

The repository contains mathematical implememtation of algorithms and some examples of how to use the implemented algorithms on the provided datasets.
