    "Customer churn analysis refers to the customer attrition rate in a company. This analysis helps identify the cause of the churn and implement effective strategies for retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Churn is used to describe subscribers to a service who decide to discontinue their service for a certain time frame. Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service.\n",

    "Businesses often have to invest substantial amounts attracting new clients, so every time a client leaves it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort then need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave and offer them incentives to stay can offer huge savings to a business."
