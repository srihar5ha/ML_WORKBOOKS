    "The universe of stocks can truly baffle investors who wish to make the best selection of stocks for their portfolios. It is a daunting task to make a prudent selection of stocks, given the vastness of the choices and the diverse behavioural characteristics of each of these stocks with respect to itself and to one another\n",

    "**Portfolio Return and Risk:**\n",
    "Harry Markowtiz proposed a framework known as Mean-Variance Analysis which won him the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics. The framework laid the foundation for what is known as the Modern Portfolio Theory, that views the *portfolio return* as the capital gain that can be expected by holding a portfolio and *portfolio risk* as the extent of capital losses that it can suffer possibly due to adverse market movements. Portfolio return and risk were modelled using the mean and variance of the portfolio's fluctuations respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diversification Index:**\n",
    "A Diversification Index quantifies diversification. There are several diversification indices discussed in the literature. Diversification Ratio proposed and patented by Yves Choueifaty in 2008 [CHO 08, CHO 13], is a diversification index of recent origin, built on the inter-dependence between assets of a portfolio. Diversification Ratio is the ratio of the weighted sum of individual asset volatilities to the portfolio's volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficient Frontier:** An efficient frontier is a set of investment portfolios that are expected to provide the highest returns at a given level of risk. A portfolio is said to be efficient if there is no other portfolio that offers higher returns for a lower or equal amount of risk. Where portfolios are located on the efficient frontier depends on the investor’s degree of risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharpe Ratio:** The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio."
